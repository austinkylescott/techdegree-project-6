          p The path to your dream job is never a straight line. When I was a kid, it was a dream to learn programming and go work for Nintendo. I started learning Java during my freshman year of high school and when I went to Rochester Institute of Technology for higher education, I originally took up a degree in Game Design and Development, but I became distracted in the best way. Though I enjoyed problem solving and writing code, I had been bitten by the creativity bug. 
          p I began learning, teaching, and performing improv comedy on a regular basis, immersing myself in Rochester's entertainment community and gaining a true understanding of the word "flexibility", something I'd come to cherish over the next decade. I switched majors and graduated with an Advertising and Public Relations degree. I built my own performance organization from the ground up, and found myself advertising, promoting, and networking with other groups and businesses.
          p Fast forward 10 years, several jobs, several industries, and a new city. Improv is still a huge part of my life, but to turn my hobby into a side business, I needed to make a website to promote myself. Of course, since I was no stranger to programming, it wasn't too hard to learn how to build one myself. So I did. Now I have a slew of HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills that I want to continue to use. My roundabout path to becoming a web developer is one of my greatest strengths as I've gained unique understanding of the needs and problems facing a variety of industries, including retail management, higher education, sales and marketing, publishing, and entertainment.
          p So what now? Let's connect. It comes back to what YOU need. I'm all about flexibility. Hire me to build your next website or solve your most pressing problem. If you just want to take an improv class, don't worry, I can still do that too.
